/**
 * This module has a dual responsibility:
 *  1. Ensures that asynchronous function calls, 'f', that share the same
 *     'key' are not executed in parallel.
 *  2. In the case where an attempt to call in parallel is prevented,
 *     the 'action' callbacks are executed when the asynchronous call is
 *     completed.
 *
 * Example:
 *  When we async-map to remotely fetch module definition, it is
 *  important that only a single define is evaluated, but the
 *  notification that the definition has completed is propagated
 *  to all interested parties.
 *
 *    1. we require dependencies 'x' and 'y'
 *
 *    2. both x and y are defined in the same file  (i.e. compiled together), 'a.js'.
 *
 *    3. we resolve x and y, to their load spec using a modulator
 *        x_spec = {load: function () { -- load a.js -- }, url: a.js, serial: false};
 *        y_spec = {load: function () { -- load a.js -- }, url: a.js, serial: false};
 *
 *    4. we make the piggyback call for x:
 *        piggybacker.piggyback(x_spec.url, x_spec.load, xdone);
 *
 *       this will register the 'xdone' action, and actually
 *       trigger the load call, with a synthetic callback
 *       responsible for triggering all registered actions.
 *
 *    5. we make the piggyback call for y:
 *        piggybacker.piggyback(y_spec.url, y_spec.load, ydone);
 *
 *       this will register the 'ydone' action, but NOT trigger
 *       the load call.
 *
 *    6. the load call completes, and calls the synthetic callback,
 *       which is responsible for triggering both 'xdone' and 'ydone'.
 *
 *    7. something else happens that means we have to load 'a.js' again,
 *       the piggybacker DOES NOT prevent this call, and will follow
 *       the above process.
