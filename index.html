    <h2>Modules in Bolt</h2>

    <h3>Modules</h3>

    <p>
      The central component of a bolt project is the module.
    </p>

    <p>
      A module is essentially a named, self-contained unit of JavaScript
      code, with a specified API, that may or may not depend on other
      modules in order to accomplish its purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modules are created by calling the <code>define</code> function.
      Define has the following signature:
    </p>

    <pre>define(name, dependencies, definitionFunction);</pre>

    <p>For example, a typical bolt module definition in a project might look like:</p>

    <pre>
define(
  'example.bolt.Module',   // Module name (including namespace)

  [
    'example.bolt.AnotherModule',   // Dependencies on other modules
    'example.bolt.DifferentModule'
  ],

  function (AnotherModule, DifferentModule) {   // Definition function - passed dependencies in order
    // Private state

    var hello = function () {
      alert('Hello, world!');
    };

    // Public API (exposed to other modules)
    return {
      hello: hello
    };
  }
);
    </pre>

    <p>
      By convention, this module would live in the file
      <code>example/bolt/Module.js</code>, somewhere in the source directory
      of a project.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Modules</h3>

    <h2>Developing with Bolt</h2>

    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    <p>
      Bolt relies on a configuration file that defines what types of files
      can be loaded, where they are loaded from and potentially other
      configurations where this information can be found. The configuration
      is used for both runtime loading of modules and the compilation of
      modules.
    </p>

    <h4>Concepts</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt>configs</dt>
      <dd>
          configs are other javascript files that are used to configure bolt,
          a configuration file consists of a single <code>configure</code>
          call that takes an object with three optional keys, <code>configs</code>,
          <code>types</code> and <code>sources</code>.
      </dd>
      <dt>types</dt>
      <dd>
          component types that are groked by bolt, these component types are
          able to be loaded and compiled by bolt.
      </dd>
      <dt>sources</dt>
      <dd>
          sources specify where to load resources from, each source consists
          of a type and then a set of configuration that indicate what modules
          it can be loaded from this source and where to load them from.
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <h4>Api</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>configure({ configs: [ path ], types: [ type ], sources: [ source ] });</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A single configure call should be the only thing made in a configuration
          file.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>configs</code> are an array of strings which specify the path to another
          configuration file. Configurations are read pre-order, so sources and types specified
          take precedence over those read from the imported configs. Relative paths are defined
          relative to the file they are declared in.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>types</code> are an array of objects created by calls to the type function specified below.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>sources</code> are an array of objects created by calls to the source function specified below.
        </p>
       </dd>

      <dt><code>type(type, package);</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The type registers with bolt a module type to be loaded. The <code>amd</code> type is
          always implicitly loaded but a common example is the <code>js</code> type, which registers
          a custom type for loading raw javascript files as bolt modules.
        </p>
        <pre>type('js', 'ephox.modulator.js')</pre>
        <p>
          The implementation package specifies the base package for a type. It is expected to contain
          two modules <code>&lt;package&gt.Modulator</code>, which is used for runtime loading of the
          custom module type; and <code>&lt;package&gt.Compiler</code>, which is used for compilation
          of the custom module type.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>source(type, arguments ...)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The source function takes the type as a string as its first argument and then a variable
          number of arguments that are passed to the source types implementation. The exact argument
          formulation is dependent on the type argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the base amd type, this is of the form:
        </p>
        <p><code>source('amd', namespace, path, mapper)</code></p>
        <p>
          The <code>namespace</code> argument specifies the namespace prefix that is being configured
          by this source, i.e. only modules matching this prefix will match this source.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>path</code> specifies the path (excluding the mapped module name) to where
          the modules should be loaded from. Relative paths are defined relative to the file
          they are declared in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>mapper</code> specifies a function that takes a module name and converts it
          to a file path (exclude the '.js') extension. This is normally in the form of one of
          the convenience mappers described below.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>mapper.hierarchical</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A convenience function that specifies a function that takes a module name and
          converts it to a directory structure. For example, the module <code>example.bolt.Module</code>
          would be come the path <code>example/bolt/Module</code>. This is how modules are commonly
          layed out in source control.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>mapper.flat</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A convenience function that specifies a function that takes a module name and
          converts it to a file name. This is effectively an identity function. For example,
          the module <code>example.bolt.Module</code>  would be come the path <code>example.bolt.Module</code>.
          The bolt compiler's -m flag outputs modules in this structure.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>mapper.constant(path)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A convenience function that is used to construct a function that always returns a constant path.
          For example, a call to <code>mapper.constant('example/bolt')</code>, would convert any module name
          to the path <code>example/bolt</code>. This is useful for referencing a compiled file where
          a number of modules are contained in a single file.
        </p>
      </dd>

    </dl>


    <h3>Development Mode</h3>

    <p>
      Bolt is designed so that the some html can refer to a bootstrap file that can be in a
      development mode where modules are downloaded as individual files directly from the
      file system, or in a compiled mode where a single file is download for efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
      In development mode the system is designed to be run behind a web server that is
      serving up the actually versioned controlled source tree of your project. For pure
      javascript projects this is normally achieved by just serving up the source with
      apache or nginx. For more complex projects it would involve configuring what ever
      application server or framework is involved to serve up the module and config source
      files.
    </p>

    <p>
      A standard layout:
    </p>
    <pre>
config
|-- bolt
|   |-- bootstrap-prod.js
|   |-- prod.js
|   `-- test.js7
|
src
|-- js
|   `-- example
|       `-- bolt
|           |-- Module.js
|           |-- AnotherModule.js
|           `-- DifferentModule.js
test
`-- js
    |-- ModuleTest.js
    |-- AnotherModuleTest.js
    `-- DifferentModuleTest.js
    </pre>

    <p>
      The <code>config/bolt/prod.js</code> (default by convention but can be specified on command line), file is the production configuration.
    </p>
    <pre>
configure({
  sources: [
    source('amd', 'example.bolt', '../../src/js', mapper.hierarchical),
  ]
});
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <code>config/bolt/test.js</code> file is the test configuration. In
      this case it just delegates to the production configuration, but in a
      more complex scenario would include its own sources.
    </p>
    <pre>
configure({
  configs: [
    'prod.js'
  ]
});
    </pre>
