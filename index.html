    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Bolt is a module system for JavaScript.</p>

    <p>
        It allows JavaScript applications and libraries to split their code into
        separate files to allow the reuse of components and encourage sustainable
        JavaScript development, whilst also providing compilation to a minimal set
        of files for production deployment and performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bolt consists of a runtime module system, a compiler (jsc) for building
        optimised production distributables, a suite of tools to assist with managing
        projects (bolt) and a framework for writing componentized JavaScript.

    <h2>Docs</h2>

    <p>
        This documentation is split into three main areas, each dealing with a different
        aspect of bolt development:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="use.html">Use</a></h3>
            Documentation for the majority of bolt users. This explains
            bolt concepts, how to set up a new bolt project and how to write applications
            and libraries using bolt.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="extend.html">Extend</a></h3>
            Information on how to extend bolt to handle new kinds of resources that bolt
            doesn't handle out-of-the-box. Extensions to bolt are written using bolt itself,
            so an understanding of the topics covered in the Use section are a prerequisite.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="develop.html">Develop</a></h3>
            Design documents and architecture information for developers working on the
            bolt system itself.
        </li>
    </ul>
